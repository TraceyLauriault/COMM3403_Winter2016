## Course Description
> The course examines the contemporary and historical relationship between communication technology, society and culture, especially factors that contribute to changes in the collection, storage and distribution of information and their cultural implications.  In the first half of the course we will study the communication infrastructure from a number of perspectives: philosophically, geographically, technically, ideologically, materially, as part of nation building and discuss if and how this invisible complex technological system is and can be shaped by us, and in turn if it shapes us. 

> The second half of the course is dedicated to technologies, such as platforms, applications and software that co-evolved and were enabled in some part by the underlying communication infrastructure.  This change in scale allows us to delve more deeply into a socio-cultural-technological examination of phenomena such as hacking and vigilantism, predictive policing, and surveillance as well as sketching out how love and relationships are mediated, how money and currency are evolving, questions of identity and forms of technological resistance. 

## Course Objectives
* learn that the material technologies of the communication infrastructure are not only feats of engineering, but also that these have been shaped by science, society, culture, geography, politics and ideology;
* study old and contemporary technologies as an assemblage of artefacts, networks, systems, finance, institution, practices, and people; 
* think critically about technology by engaging with key sociological and philosophical concepts and to apply these in practice;
* acquire the knowledge and skill to identify and distinguish technological narratives and the vocabulary to describe and articulate them
* improve their ability to conduct research, collect and read different forms of information

## Week 1 (Jan.11) – Introduction – What is Technology?
_Welcome to the class!_ We will get to know each other, go over the course outline, class deliverables, and learning objective.  We will begin to define technology, and explore its meaning by discussing the devices and apps we wear, carry with us and use every day.  You will also begin to learn how to frame technology ideologically by examining a classic article called _The Californian Ideology_.  It is an older article but one that science fiction and technology writer, Bruce Sterling in Wired (2014) considers “_still entertainingly bonkers, but now that we’ve managed to toss the NSA and the surveillance-marketing Stacks into the cultural mix, it looks a lot more up-to-date than some of the period reactions against it at the time it was written — way back in 1995 AD._”

#### Readings: 
* Slack & Wise, (2015). [Chapter 1: The Power and Problem of Culture, The Power and Problem of Technology](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3825528), p.5-13. (8 pages)

#### Assignment 1 (Due midnight Jan. 17) (10%): 
> In 2 pages (single spaced 12 pt font), you are to write about a technology that you carry with you every day, it can be a device or an app, one you think you cannot do without, it could be for a health reason, social reason, economic reason, or all of the above.  Name the device or app, name the company who made it, state where it is made, the cost, does it rely on any underlying infrastructure, if there are ongoing costs, to whom do you pay these costs, how often have you replaced it, if there is a terms of use, what is it and who owns the data and what are your privacy rights, describe the device aesthetically, instrumentally, and emotionally and discuss how you use it, and what would happen if you did not.  Also, engage with concepts you learned in class.

## Week 2 (Jan. 18) – The Philosophy of Technology
This week, you will begin to learn how to think philosophically about technology. The philosophy of technology and science and technology studies (STS) are well established fields of inquiry. These fields have new critical study offshoots such as software, platform, algorithm, data and infrastructure studies. In this class, we will discuss whether or not technologies are neutral instrumental artifacts, if they have politics, and if so can we use them with heart?

#### Assignment 1 is due

## Week 3 (Jan. 25) – Nation & the Canadian Communication Infrastructure

This class will take place in room **NL252 in the Library and in the MADGIC section of the library**. In Week 1, we thought about personal devices, in Week 2 we framed technology philosophically by looking at artifacts, systems and networks.  This week we increase the scale and scope and consider the very material aspects a large technological system. We will do so by studying the curated map, atlas and document display in the MADGIC section of the Library entitled the _Evolution of the Canadian Communication Infrastructure_ - made especially for you.  You will learn to read new and historical communication technology maps, about the economic geography of communication, and consider policy, politics, and business as these pertain to communication and nation building.

#### Reading:

* Communication and Media, pp. 256-273 (17 pages)

#### Assignment 2: (15% - 2 parts).  This is a 2 part assignment. 

#### Part A (5%) during the library session.

> In the MacOdrum Library Map, Data and Government Information Centre (MADGIC) on the ground floor there is a map display for COMM3403 / COMM4419.  There you will find a series of historical maps on the Evolution of the Communication Infrastructure in Canada.  The maps are organized into 6 groups, and in each group there is accompanying documentation. You will be assigned a groups of maps and documents to look at and will be handed a table like the following to fill in.  

> In the observation column, describe any spatial patterns and any relationships you think exist between the maps within each group, and in the last row you will include observations about spatial patterns between the maps, and/or the topics, and/or the relationship between technologies, and/or the differences in technologies. _**Some of these maps and books are very old and rare so please treat them with care**_.  Finally, discuss in a few sentences your thoughts about the infrastructure at that time.

#### Part B (10%) due Week 4 Midnight Feb.1

> You will have been pointed to a number of manuscripts from the Canada Year Books (1861-2011) as well as three Commissions (1929, 1949-51 & 1957) while in the Library. In addition, 6 of the Year Books include a special history of communications in Canada (1932, 1933, 1947, 1957-58, 1959 and 1967).  While in the Library you will be assigned to read one of these, and are asked to write a 3 page report of your findings, you may want to also refer to a map. How were things measured, what indicators were featured, what technologies were discussed, what was considered grand and innovative, were any key figures mentioned and if so who were they, were any policies, laws, regulations mentioned, what key actors were discussed (i.e., unions, associations, private sector entities etc.) and how do you think what you read relates to the construction of the Canada as a nation. 

> Be sure to cite what you have read, and be sure to include the headings of the sections and subsections in your report. In class you will provide a short verbal 2 minute report of your findings. No slides.

## Week 4 (Feb. 2) – Internet Infrastructure

* We will dedicate the 1st part of class to your 2 min reports (2 Marks) followed by a brief discussion period where you will share your reflections of the map, atlas and manuscript display.

* The week before you intensively studied the evolution of Canada’s communication infrastructure.  This week we will envision the internet infrastructure as an articulation and an assemblage, we will discuss how it has shaped how we think of space and time, and about the material unevenness of the network. You will also learn about a field called internet studies and what scholars have discovered by doing research in the field.

## Week 5 (Feb. 8) – Doing Infrastructure Citizenship

To date we have examined technology as a system, an artefact, philosophically, politically and geographically, this week we change tracks and examine how ‘non traditional’ actors are engaged in the shaping of the communication infrastructure and its related policies. We will ground our study by looking at civil society, citizens at large, think tanks, academia and technology associations as actors engaged in shaping the communication infrastructure via overseas development, local access initiatives, consultations and public interest groups.

## Week 8 (Mar. 7) – The Sharing Economy

In this lecture we examine the sharing economy, some of its models, transaction platforms and distributed networks, crowdfunding, the blockchain and bitcoin, the LETS system, participatory budgets and PayPal.  We will discuss control, alternative paths, the disappearance of the cash economy and how that relates to surveillance and control. We will encounter libertarianism, counter neo-liberal agendas, alternative financing, and how to manage trust.  The hacker spirit (Week 6) and algorithms (Week 7) make another appearance under another guise here.

## Week 11 (Mar. 28) – Surveillance, Biometrics, Snowden

Julian Assange and Edward Snowden have changed the nature of media reporting, their actions put a spotlight on the privatization of the internet infrastructure, the monitoring of content and government snooping.  Since then, traditional media channels have been put into question and blackboxed state secrets about the misdeeds of government were made public.  Irrespective of whether we consider them to be villains, vigilantes or heroes, our relationship with media and government has changed as a result of their actions. This week we take a look at the repercussions of Wikileaks and Snowden, and you will learn about the normalization of biometrics.
